# Personal Website

> Personal Portfolio for Lucas Patel

## Technologies

This website was built using [Nuxt.js](https://nuxtjs.org), an extensive Vue.js framework. The styling includes some components from both [Bulma](https://bulma.io) and [Buefy](https://buefy.github.io/#/).

## Build Setup

If you'd like to run this project locally, simply clone this repository and run the following commands:

``` bash
# install dependencies
$ npm install # Or yarn install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:3000
$ npm run dev

# build for production and launch server
$ npm run build
$ npm start

# generate static project, used for deployment
$ npm run generate
```

For detailed explanation on how things work, visit the [Nuxt.js docs](https://github.com/nuxt/nuxt.js).
